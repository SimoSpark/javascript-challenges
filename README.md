# ðŸ§  JavaScript Challenges

Welcome to my JavaScript Challenges repo!  
Here Iâ€™m solving different JavaScript problems to practice logic and improve my coding skills.

## âœ… Solved Challenges

| Challenge         | Description                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|

| `fizzbuzz-twist` |FizzBuzz challenge with a twist |
| `factorial-finder` |calcul the factorial of a number |
| `tobe-orNot-toBe` |leetcode the 3rd day challenge |
| `word-frequency-counter` |Count how many times each word appears in a sentence |
| `Password-Generator` |Generates a random password based on giving settings |



## ðŸ“Œ How it works

Each challenge is inside its own folder with the code and a small explanation or visual.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- HTML & CSS (for visual challenges)
- Git & GitHub <br/>
I'll keep updating this repo as I solve more problems like:
- Reverse a string
- Check for palindromes
- FizzBuzz
- And more...
  
 ## ðŸŒ± Why I'm Doing This

I want to:
- Practice solving problems with JavaScript ðŸ’¡
- Get better at coding interviews & logic
- Build a strong foundation before diving into advanced topics like React, Node.js, and AI ðŸ§ 

Stay tuned!
