# ðŸ§  JavaScript Challenges

Welcome to my JavaScript Challenges repo!  
Here Iâ€™m solving different JavaScript problems to practice logic and improve my coding skills.

## âœ… Solved Challenges

| Challenge         | Description                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `second-highest` | Find the second largest number in an array  |

## ðŸ“Œ How it works

Each challenge is inside its own folder with the code and a small explanation or visual.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- HTML & CSS (for visual challenges)
- Git & GitHub
I'll keep updating this repo as I solve more problems like:
- Reverse a string
- Check for palindromes
- FizzBuzz
- And more...
  
 ## ðŸŒ± Why I'm Doing This

I want to:
- Practice solving problems with JavaScript ðŸ’¡
- Get better at coding interviews & logic
- Build a strong foundation before diving into advanced topics like React, Node.js, and AI ðŸ§ 

Stay tuned!

Feel free to fork this repo and try solving the challenges yourself!
